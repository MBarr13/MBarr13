- 👋 Hi, I’m @MBarr13
- About me: Melissa Barr is ready to meet 21st Century challenges with a 22nd Century strategy. Tempering inspired solutions with practical processes, she is not just a visionary, but a veteran data tactician. She brings order to chaotic spreadsheets. She pulls away junk data to reveal the true artifacts of history. A Millennial Oracle of Delphi, she has foreseen trends in the reports – and can pinpoint where to diverge from habitual patterns for a different fate. She has built transcendent stories upon humble clay and aged paper, within lines of code, on the sight of a single graph or chart, and for the unseen masses of future consumers.
